# Sentiment Analysis API

## üìå Overview
The **Sentiment Analysis API** analyzes Reddit posts and comments to determine their sentiment as **positive, negative, or neutral**. It helps understand public opinion trends and provides insights into online discussions.

## üöÄ Features
- User-friendly **UI** to input a topic name and number of posts to analyze.
- Fetch Reddit posts and comments using **Redis**.
- Analyze the sentiment of Reddit posts and comments.
- Process large amounts of text data efficiently.
- Provide insights into trending sentiment.
- User sentiment dashboard for historical analysis.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask** (for API development)
- **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** (for sentiment analysis)
- **NLTK** (for text preprocessing)
- **Redis** (for caching and storing fetched Reddit data)
- **PostgreSQL** (using Render database for storing sentiment results)
- **Render** (for deployment)
- **HTML, CSS** (for UI development)

## üì• Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Redis server (local or cloud-based)


# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂ Usage

### Running the API
